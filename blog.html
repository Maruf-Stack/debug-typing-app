                    Question 1 : What is the difference between Local Storage and Session Storage?

                <h4>
                    <span class="fs-2 fw-bold">Ans : </span><strong>Local storage </strong>: Local storage is
                    permenent.This read-only interface property
                    provides access to
                    the Document's local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions.<br>
                    <strong>Session storage </strong> : Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets
                    cleared when the
                    page session ends that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a
                    browser is closed.

                    <span class="fs-2 fw-bold">Ans : </span> Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have
                    Global Scope.
                    Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.This is call as Global
                    scope.<br>
                    let,const is block scope variable.There are the feature of ES6.let and const cannot be declare
                    outside of the function or its block.This is call as block scope.

                    Question 3 : How does Event loop works?
                </h2>
                <h4>
                    <span class="fs-2 fw-bold">Ans : </span> JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop,
                    which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued
                    sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.<br>
                    Ganerally,The event loop works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider"
                    (that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), then calls the relevant event
                    handler ("dispatches the event").Each message is processed completely before any other message is
                    processed.

                    <span class="fs-2 fw-bold">Ans : </span>There are many reason we get undefined.Some are given below
